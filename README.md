# 3004\ coded in C++ and uses user interface configuration file for definitions of Qt widgets with slots and signals

The files in this folder 3004 represent my knowledge of diffrent user cases in programs such as an elevator. An elevator has many diffrent stake holders
and those stake holders have many diffrent functionalities, the pdf file describes all of these funtions using uml diagrams, stake holder diagrams and diffrent use cases
for diffrent scenarios.

The Team4 file is a file which includes code that simulates the function of a DENAS device (Dynamic electrical nerve stimulation) this device is used as a physio therapy 
treatment tool it dilevers a wide range of frequencies to relieve pain in joints and nervs. this tool can be used by diffrent aged children at diffrent frequencies.
All the functions, stake holders and use cases are included within this file aswell as a simulation of the device brought to you through code created by me and other 
classmates of mines mentioned in the file.
